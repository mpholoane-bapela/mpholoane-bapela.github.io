# Teaching AI to Scaffold a .NET Clean Architecture Solution

Starting a new .NET project often feels like repeating the same steps over and over again:

- Create a solution  
- Add multiple projects  
- Configure references  
- Install NuGet packages  
- Enforce architectural guidelines  

Even if you're experienced, this process typically takes **10–15 minutes** every time.  

But what if you could automate all of it?  

Recently, I decided to experiment with **Agent Skills**—a way to teach AI coding agents how to perform specific development workflows. Instead of manually setting up the project structure, I created an Agent Skill that automates the entire scaffolding process for a **Clean Architecture-based .NET solution**.

## What Are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are **reusable workflows that extend AI coding agents with specialized capabilities**. Think of them as "playbooks" for AI—instead of repeatedly explaining the same task to the assistant, you define a repeatable procedure that the agent can execute whenever needed.

A typical Agent Skill includes:

- Step-by-step instructions  
- Optional scripts or templates  
- Any resources required for the task  

When the AI detects a relevant task, it loads the skill and **executes the workflow automatically**. This concept is gaining traction in tools like **Visual Studio Code** through AI assistants like **GitHub Copilot**.

## The Skill I Built

In this case, I created an Agent Skill that scaffolds a **.NET solution following Clean Architecture principles**. When invoked, the AI automatically:

1. Creates a new solution  
2. Generates the required projects (e.g., `Domain`, `Application`, `Infrastructure`, `Web`)  
3. Adds project references  
4. Installs necessary NuGet packages  
5. Enforces the expected architecture structure  

Instead of spending **10–15 minutes** manually setting everything up, the AI creates the entire baseline **in seconds**.

## Why This Is Useful

### ⏱ Faster Project Setup
Manual scaffolding is time-consuming. With an Agent Skill, the process becomes nearly instant.  

### 📐 Consistent Architecture
Every project starts with the **same conventions and structure**, which is especially helpful for teams working on multiple projects.  

### 🤖 AI That Executes Workflows
This goes beyond generating code snippets. AI agents can now handle deterministic development tasks, saving you time and reducing errors.

## The Bigger Idea

Agent Skills represent a shift in how developers interact with AI. Instead of relying on AI as a passive assistant, we can now **teach it repeatable engineering procedures**.  

Once defined, these skills can serve as building blocks for larger workflows, such as:

- Specification-driven development  
- Automated project scaffolding  
- Environment setup  
- Testing pipelines  

We’re moving from **AI assistants** to **AI-powered development workflows**—and the possibilities are exciting.
